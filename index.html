                    Ever since I was a kid, I was fascinated by computers and all the amazing things you could do with them. On the family computer I played flash games, messed around with MSPaint and Skyped my family members. One day, I learned that if you change a file to say .bat instead of .txt, you could give the computer commands to follow. I had stumbled upon programming without even knowing! After getting bored of making console applications in batch, I taught myself more programming languages (FreeBASIC, Python, C++) and delved deeper and deeper into the world of computer science. That love of machinery and coding has stayed with me for over a decade, and has finally brought me to full stack development, where my skills can flourish as I take on new challenges. Debugging can be a pain, but the satisfaction of creating complex programs from scratch, for me, is more than worth it. I can't wait to work with you and to see what new challenges are in store.
